# dataStructuresLab1

This lab is due 9/16/16
It is lab 1 for Data Structures

The goal of the lab is to create a class that can handle big integers. 
C++ only allows the storage of ints so big, thus we need to create our own class for larger ones.

The class I created is called HugeInteger and it allows for the addition, multiplication, and comparison of large integers.
